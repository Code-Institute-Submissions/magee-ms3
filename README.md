# Mike Magee - Code Institute Milestone 3  Honey-Do app 


The requirement of this project is to "... build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain."

Even before the Task Manager mini project was presented, I have wanted to build an electronic "Job Jar" similar to the on in the "Hi and Louis" strip.  We currently have a yellow sticky version of this called the Honey Do wall.

My approach was to provide an intuitive app with a clean presentation. 

The fundamental use case for this first version is: 
    - A family has one "account" with basic name/password validation
    - Within this account there are users eg: Dad, Mom, child1 etc.. 
    - Anyone can create a project, assign goals, priority and "reward points" 
    - Anyone can open, complete and earn the award points. 
    - Categories and users can be added and managed

## UX 

### User goals 
* An app that is simple to approach and use. 
* Controls and interactions that are familiar and predictable.
* Responsive across device types.
* Somewhat fun. 

### User Stories 
* As a user I expect the app to be usable without instruction if possible
* As a user I expect adding a new project to be simple and fast
* As a user I expect accessing, opening and closing projects to be simple
* As a user I expect searching for projects via various criteria to be intuitive
* As a user I want to be able to observe how many projects are in what state. 
* As a user I want to be know how many projects are in each category 
* As a user I want to be able to have the App "Pop" a project off based on criteria.

Wireframes for usability on Desktop 
Note that because this project was focused on database and CRUD I did not do the wireframes for them, 
and retroactively for the desktop

- [Initial idea](project/Initial_Drawing.png)
- [Initial Registration](project/Initial_Drawing.png)
- [Initial Entry](project/Entry_login_Desktop.png)
- [Registration](project/Register_Desktop.png)
- [Add a User](project/add_user_desktop.png)
- [Initial Home - no projects](project/projects_none_Desktop.png)
- [Adding a project](project/create_project_desktop.png)
- [Home with projects](project/Home_desktop.png)
- [Closed view](project/Closed_readonly_view.png)




## MINIMUM Features (Must Have) 
- **Simple Interface**: Must have a simple interface free of distraction and complexity 
- **Next Feature**: 

<br> <br>

## STRETCH Features (Nice to have) 
- **tbd**: 


<br> 
*** 

## DEFERRED Features (Wish I could, maybe I will) 
- **Email Notification**: Status email (Open, close etc) to creator

## What I learned 
- ** Python coding **: I didn't lint it until the end.  I learned that I should lint before EVERY checkin. 
- ** Jinja HTML Validation **: A combination of copying the resolved HTML from the browser as well as using the source HTML provided the best results.

## Testing 

** MJM Confirm current browser versions 
There should be no visible difference in behavior between browsers.  I have tested with:  
- Chrome Version 86.0.4240.198 
- Firefox Version 75.0 (64-bit)
- Safari Version  13.1.2 (15609.3.5.1.3)

All tests described below have worked successfully across all browsers.
Responsiveness checks have been run by using the Chrome developers's tools as well as manually resizing the windows  


** MJM Outline testing results and observations here 
In general everything "worked".  I did however feel the need to set the tests in orange for some test below.

In terms of responsiveness,
    - Firefox had an odd behavior with field validation showing red when it should have been green. 
    - The action buttons on the project summary just looked bad on the iPhone.  I could not get around that.
    - Axross all browsers, the first and last entries in the dropdowns  were VREY finicky.  
      You had to select them JUST right to avoid triggering whatever was behind them.

## Validation
    HTML Verification
During HTM validation the following errors surfaced that I could not or (for the h2=h6) didn't feel was necessary to address

    Section lacks heading. Consider using “h2”-“h6” elements to add identifying headings to all sections.
     - I assume this is OK for what we are doing here
    
    Attribute “method” not allowed on element “div” at this point.
        From line 41, column 13 to line 41, column 69
        Code Extract:
        <div class="input-field col s12" method="POST" action="">↩
    - I found no way to get around it. 
    
    The “select” element cannot have more than one selected “option” descendant unless the “multiple” attribute is specified.
        From line 99, column 21 to line 99, column 50
        Code Extract:
        <option value="Home" selected>Home<
        This came from a Code Institute example of the Materialize selection. 
    - I found no way to get around it. 

## Deployment

This sample site is set up to use Heroku as a deployment target.  
** MJM CONFIRM
- App location is: https://magee-ms3.herokuapp.com

** MJM Describe environment variables required to run
    - MS3_ENVIRONMENT
    - MS3_MONGO_DBN
    - MS3_MONGO_URI
    - IP 
    - PORT 
    - SECRET_KEY 

This sample site can easily edited and run locally in the VSCode IDE by using the GoLive feature, which is how this code was developed.  To do this:
- From a terminal in the appropriate location clone a copy of the code locally: 
    - run: `git clone https://github.com/michaelmagee/magee-MS3.git`
    - then run `git remote rm origin` to remove the remote references to github.
- Then from VSCode, open a new window and open the newly cloned directory.   The Go Live button is on the bottom right.
### Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`git pull`   To be sure that the code is current
`python3 -m http.server`  

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.
